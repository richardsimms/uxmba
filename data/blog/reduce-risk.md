Instead of over investing in a solution that doesn't excite your target customer. Test the assumptions that have weak evidence and are important, reduce the size by assumption testing the viability, feasibility, desirability, usability, and ethics of each.

Here are five examples:

a) **Customer interviews** is always the place to start to explore the desirability and viability of assumptions by focusing on their jobs, pains, gains and willingness to pay

b) **Search trend analysis** is a great way to perform market research on particular search terms volume and related queries that align to your assumptions.

c) **Online adverts** can test your assumptions value proposition with a simple call to action with your target audience.

d) **Concierge** service where you manually deliver the value to the customer, whilst learning how to better capture and deliver value.

e) **Reverse income statement** will help you to understand just how viable your assumptions are – by working backwards to prototype the numbers required to achieve a desired business outcome, combined with your current conversion rate you can go as far as understanding how many dally visitors you’ll need to attract to meet your goal.
