The UX MBA is a newsletter, written by [Richard Simms](rsimms.com.md "Richard Simms"). To provide leadership, management, and career advice to UX professionals.

A free newsletter published semi-frequently and focuses on the business & leadership skills necessary for User Experience Designers to succeed at the executive level. I write about connecting the dots, between business outcomes and customers experience, to deliver business growth.

There’s going to be very little advice about UX tools or methods. Instead, I’m going to focus on principle to help you become a more confident and effective at presenting to executives. Sharing your research, organise opportunities and prove the value of design in order to get things done. 

To be an effective product leader, you need some business skills. You need the ability to present ideas to the c-suite, create a compelling business case for multi-million dollar investments, and work cross-functionally to gather buy-in from stakeholders.
