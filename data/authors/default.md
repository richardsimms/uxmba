The UX MBA is a newsletter, written by [Richard Simms](rsimms.com.md "Richard Simms"). To provide leadership, management, and career advice to UX professionals. About connecting the dots, between business outcomes and customers experience, to deliver impactful design work. 

Thereâ€™s going to be very little advice about UX tools or methods. Instead, I will focus on principles to help you create more impact by focusing on the business of design. From the research, experiments, and metrics required to prove the value of design aligned to business objectives. 

To be an effective product leader, you need some business skills. You need the ability to present ideas to the c-suite, create a compelling business case for multi-million dollar investments, and work cross-functionally to gather buy-in from stakeholders.
