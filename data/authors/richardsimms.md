I'm a UX/product designer, currently creating product and services, to help people make great [career decisions](https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/) at [SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au). Before that, I led the design practice at [Open Universities Australia](http://open.edu.au/), designed [native mobile apps](https://www.suncorp.com.au/banking/help-support/ways-to-bank/suncorp-app.html?intcmp=SUN:GI:PI:NPS:OSL:20180729:2911) for Suncorp bank, and led experience design for a leading London creative agency.

On the side, I built a not-for-profit marketplace for volunteers to make scrubs (uniforms) for [healthcare heroes](http://rsimms.com/ronascrubs/) in response to COVID-19 in Australia. Recently I began [writing](http://uxmba.substack.com/) about leadership, management, and career advice to UX and product professionals.
